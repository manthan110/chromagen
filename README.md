Project Abstract:

ChromaGen is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline and inspire the color palette creation process for designers and developers. Color plays a vital role in user experience, influencing emotion, guiding attention, and ensuring accessibility. However, crafting aesthetically pleasing palettes that also comply with accessibility standards such as WCAG is often time-consuming and requires manual effort.

ChromaGen solves this by leveraging generative AI to translate natural language prompts or inspirational images into complete, harmonious, and ready-to-use design palettes. The platform also includes automated accessibility auditing, ensuring generated palettes meet WCAG contrast ratio requirements and are inclusive for all users.

This tool empowers designers by reducing the burden of manual tweaking, sparking creativity, and enabling rapid, compliant, and professional palette generation.
